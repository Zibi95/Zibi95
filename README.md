🙋‍♂️   My name is Sylwester Sobczak. I live in Poland, and I'm studying electrical engineering. During my studies I started to learn programming. My journey began with JS, since I want to become a front end developer. Currently I'm working, studying and taking my first steps in programming.

❤️   I love reading books and watching personal development materials. To maintain balance, I regularly go to the gym. My hobby is kayaking, which I really enjoy. It's a great way to stay active and explore the outdoors.

🌱   I’m currently learning React library and how to contribute to first open source project.
